## Introduction

This project uses the **YFinance** library to fetch historical stock data for Google and implements a neural network model for stock price prediction. The main goal is to gain a basic understanding of neural networks and their application to financial data.

---

## Features

- Fetch historical stock price data using YFinance.
- Preprocess and visualize the data.
- Implement a neural network for time-series prediction.
- Evaluate the model's performance through visualizations and metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the entire project.
- **YFinance**: For accessing historical stock data.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train the neural network.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
